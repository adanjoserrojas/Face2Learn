3. **Learning Support**: Users receive contextual learning advice, strategies, and encouragement

## üìù Features

- **Real-time emotion detection** with confidence scores
- **Personalized educational prompts** based on detected emotions
- **Learning strategies** tailored to emotional state
- **Encouragement and motivation** appropriate for each emotion
- **Actionable tips** for immediate implementation

## üé® UI Components

- **Overlay prompts** appear on YouTube videos with detected emotions
- **Extension popup** shows captured snapshots with learning insights
- **Beautiful gradient design** with smooth animations
- **Auto-dismiss** prompts after 10 seconds

## üîß Configuration

The system uses configurable templates for different emotions:

- **Happy**: "Great Learning Energy!" - Encourages continued engagement
